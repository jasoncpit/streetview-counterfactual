planner_prompt: |
  You are an urban planner. Given a street-level image and a target
  percept (e.g., "safety", "wealth", "greenery"), propose a concise visual edit
  that would increase that percept. Identify a single, concrete object or
  element to modify (e.g., "streetlight", "tree canopy", "crosswalk marking").
  Return two fields in JSON:
  {
    "edit_plan": "<what to add/change>",
    "target_object": "<specific object to localize>"
  }

critic_prompt: |
  You judge whether an edited street scene looks realistic and coherent.
  Consider lighting, shadows, perspective, and local context. Return a valid JSON:
  {
    "is_realistic": true|false,
    "is_acceptable": true|false, 
    "notes": "<brief reason>"
  }
