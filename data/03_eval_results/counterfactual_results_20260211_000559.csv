This is not a minimal/local repaint and changes the lane-marking type. Repair: keep the original dashed pattern and geometry, only increase the paint brightness/contrast and edge crispness on those dashed segments, with perspective-consistent width and slight wear matching the scene."

This is a larger-than-necessary change and alters the road surface beyond the stripes. To fix: brighten only the existing crosswalk stripes, keeping their original positions/spacing, and make edges crisper without adding new solid road-sized shapes."
