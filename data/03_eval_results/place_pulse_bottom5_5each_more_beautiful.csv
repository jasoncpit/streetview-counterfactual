No obvious viewpoint/lighting drift, but the requested repaint edit was not applied. To fix: mask only the corrugated wall area and apply an even medium-gray paint layer that preserves corrugation texture/shadows while removing rust/stains."

The change is localized to the shutter and looks physically plausible. No noticeable drift in camera/viewpoint, global color/lighting, or surrounding objects."

No obvious artifacts, and the rest of the scene (buildings, road, lighting, viewpoint) appears unchanged."

The change is localized to the facade with no noticeable additions/removals or viewpoint/style drift. If improving further, keep subtle texture/shadow variation so the repaint doesn’t look slightly flat in brighter areas."

Edit looks physically plausible and localized to the target wall with no noticeable viewpoint or global color drift."
