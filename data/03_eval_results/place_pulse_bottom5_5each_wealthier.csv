To improve, keep the pole’s original diameter/geometry and retain attached hardware while only changing the surface finish to a clean coat."

The change is localized to the wall surface, with consistent perspective and lighting; surrounding objects and overall scene appearance remain unchanged."

The change is localized to the van with no noticeable alterations to the rest of the scene (camera/viewpoint, lighting, or surrounding objects) beyond the repaint."

The edit also appears to spill slightly beyond natural road boundaries in places, making it look cut-out rather than newly paved. To fix: add fine asphalt texture/noise and subtle shading consistent with sun direction, feather edges into existing shoulders, preserve road crown/perspective cues, and avoid a single flat black fill."

The edit is localized to the window area with no noticeable changes to viewpoint, global color/lighting, or surrounding objects. If stricter minimality is desired, keep the replacement closer to the original window’s size/position while updating only the frame/material."
