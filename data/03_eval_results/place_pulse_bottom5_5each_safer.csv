The edit appears localized to the porch light area with no noticeable changes to camera/viewpoint, global color/lighting, or surrounding objects. If a more 'modern LED-style wall lamp' is required, the fixture shape could be made more contemporary (clean rectangular/sconce design) while keeping the same placement and localized illumination."

No obvious changes to surrounding buildings, wires, walls, or camera viewpoint/color balance. If anything, ensure the new panels retain some weathering/age to better match the rest of the structure, but the edit is plausible and localized."

The scene otherwise appears consistent with no major viewpoint or lighting drift. To satisfy the edit plan, cleanly inpaint/erase the wire coils across the entire wall top (including distant sections) while preserving the wall edge, sky, and background details."

The markings ignore road wear/perspective blending and look composited. To fix: locate the actual crosswalk area and repaint only those stripes, keeping correct crosswalk geometry (short transverse bars), consistent perspective, slight texture/edge wear, and matching scene lighting."

Surrounding wall, barbed wire, sky, and car remain consistent with no noticeable viewpoint or global color/lighting drift. Only minor smoothing/blur in the cleaned area; if desired, add a bit more pavement texture/noise to better match the original ground detail."
