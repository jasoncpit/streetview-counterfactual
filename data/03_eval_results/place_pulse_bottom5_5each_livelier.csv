The edit appears localized to the wall panels with no noticeable viewpoint, global color/lighting, or surrounding context drift."

The color change looks plausible with consistent shading and no noticeable spillover or artifacts. Edit is localized to the car with no camera/viewpoint or global color drift detected."

The change is localized to the facade with no noticeable camera, lighting, or surrounding-object drift."

This violates minimality and causes drift in scene appearance. Repair: apply a localized mask only to the concrete wall surfaces and change their paint color to a bright saturated hue while keeping all other areas (vegetation, road, sky) unchanged in color and lighting."

No noticeable changes to camera viewpoint, global color/contrast, or surrounding objects/background."
