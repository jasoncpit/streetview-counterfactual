However, the edit is not minimal: additional trees/shrubs in the left background also appear to have reduced foliage/turned barer compared to the original. To improve, confine the change strictly to the specified tree canopy and keep all other vegetation unchanged."

Instead, there appears to be a broad blurry dark smudge/band across the lower-right area (including storefront/shutter zone) that looks like an editing artifact rather than physically plausible soot streaks. It also affects a wider area than a localized facade stain. Repair: add textured, irregular soot discoloration anchored to facade features (e.g., below windows/vents), with directional vertical streaking and proper blending to the wall surface, keeping the change confined strictly to the facade."

However, the edit is not minimal: it affects many trees across the scene (overall vegetation/seasonal look) rather than being localized to just the specified tree canopy, and the surrounding foliage/greenery appearance shifts noticeably. To improve, restrict the mask to only the target canopy area and avoid altering other trees/understory or global color/season cues."

No obvious drift in scene, camera, or lighting, but the requested trunk repainting is not evident. Reapply a localized texture/paint edit on the visible trunk area (left foreground) with darker irregular blotches while preserving existing bark texture and scene lighting."

In the edited image, the yellow school bus at right appears to have been replaced/changed into a white vehicle, which is a major content change rather than repainting. To fix: keep the same bus and only modify its paint surface—reduce saturation/brightness, add patchy faded areas and localized rust streaks—without changing the vehicle type, position, or the rest of the scene."
