1,more beautiful,metal wall,"Repaint the corrugated metal wall to a clean, uniform medium-gray finish, covering the rust streaks and discoloration.",True,False,"The edited image appears essentially unchanged from the original: the corrugated metal wall still shows the same rust streaks and discoloration rather than a clean, uniform medium-gray repaint. No obvious viewpoint/lighting drift, but the requested repaint edit was not applied. To fix: mask only the corrugated wall area and apply an even medium-gray paint layer that preserves corrugation texture/shadows while removing rust/stains.",/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/01_raw/place_pulse_bottom5_5each/more_beautiful/01_more_beautiful_513e1d1efdc9f03587009902.jpg,/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/02_counterfactual/image_edit_baseline_20260212_211224_954840.jpg,assets/01_original.jpg,assets/01_edited.jpg
2,more beautiful,storefront shutter,"Repaint the metal shutter a clean, uniform light gray to remove stains and discoloration.",True,True,"The storefront shutter on the left appears repainted to a cleaner, more uniform light gray with stains/discoloration reduced. The change is localized to the shutter and looks physically plausible. No noticeable drift in camera/viewpoint, global color/lighting, or surrounding objects.",/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/01_raw/place_pulse_bottom5_5each/more_beautiful/02_more_beautiful_513e7039fdc9f0358700c69d.jpg,/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/02_counterfactual/image_edit_baseline_20260212_211244_830790.jpg,assets/02_original.jpg,assets/02_edited.jpg
3,more beautiful,trash bags,Remove the small pile of trash bags from the sidewalk area.,True,True,"The small pile of trash bags on the sidewalk has been removed and replaced with plausible sidewalk texture. No obvious artifacts, and the rest of the scene (buildings, road, lighting, viewpoint) appears unchanged.",/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/01_raw/place_pulse_bottom5_5each/more_beautiful/03_more_beautiful_50f5eb70fdc9f065f0008350.jpg,/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/02_counterfactual/image_edit_baseline_20260212_211301_665779.jpg,assets/03_original.jpg,assets/03_edited.jpg
4,more beautiful,building facade,"Repaint the building facade a clean, uniform light color to cover stains and discoloration.",True,True,"The building facade appears repainted to a cleaner, more uniform light tone, plausibly covering stains/discoloration. The change is localized to the facade with no noticeable additions/removals or viewpoint/style drift. If improving further, keep subtle texture/shadow variation so the repaint doesn’t look slightly flat in brighter areas.",/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/01_raw/place_pulse_bottom5_5each/more_beautiful/04_more_beautiful_50f5e565fdc9f065f0006833.jpg,/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/02_counterfactual/image_edit_baseline_20260212_211321_343322.jpg,assets/04_original.jpg,assets/04_edited.jpg
5,more beautiful,wall,"Repaint the graffiti-marked wall surface to a uniform clean light color, covering all scribbles and stains.",True,True,"The wall area appears repainted to a uniform clean light color and the visible graffiti/scribbles are removed, while the rest of the scene (road, vehicles, buildings, trees, lighting) remains unchanged. Edit looks physically plausible and localized to the target wall with no noticeable viewpoint or global color drift.",/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/01_raw/place_pulse_bottom5_5each/more_beautiful/05_more_beautiful_51392666818ede1296001074.jpg,/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/02_counterfactual/image_edit_baseline_20260212_211356_146975.jpg,assets/05_original.jpg,assets/05_edited.jpg
