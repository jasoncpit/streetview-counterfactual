1,more boring,crosswalk stripes,Repaint the crosswalk stripes to be faded and patchy so they blend more with the asphalt.,False,False,"The crosswalk stripes in the edited image do not appear repainted to be faded/patchy; they remain bright, solid, and high-contrast like the original. There is also noticeable global drift (overall image looks sharper/cleaner and slightly different in tone), suggesting changes beyond the target object. To fix: apply localized wear to the white stripes only (reduced opacity, uneven edges, asphalt-colored scuffs/gaps) while keeping the rest of the scene identical in color/contrast and preserving the same camera/viewpoint.",/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/01_raw/place_pulse_bottom5_5each/more_boring/01_more_boring_50f43b78fdc9f065f0003176.jpg,/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/02_counterfactual/image_edit_baseline_20260212_210222_550835.jpg,assets/01_original.jpg,assets/01_edited.jpg
2,more boring,car,Repaint the red car in a dull neutral gray to make it blend into the street scene.,True,True,"The car’s body color appears changed from red to a dull neutral gray while keeping the rest of the street scene consistent. Lighting, shadows, and surrounding objects look unchanged, and the repaint is localized to the car with no noticeable camera/viewpoint or global color drift.",/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/01_raw/place_pulse_bottom5_5each/more_boring/02_more_boring_513d7cfdfdc9f03587007090.jpg,/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/02_counterfactual/image_edit_baseline_20260212_210245_716440.jpg,assets/02_original.jpg,assets/02_edited.jpg
3,more boring,awning,"Repaint the awning to a uniform dull gray, removing its bright color variation.",True,True,"The awning has been repainted to a uniform dull gray, with plausible shading consistent with the scene. The change appears localized to the awning fabric with no noticeable drift in camera viewpoint, global lighting/color, or surrounding objects.",/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/01_raw/place_pulse_bottom5_5each/more_boring/03_more_boring_50f43b90fdc9f065f0003217.jpg,/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/02_counterfactual/image_edit_baseline_20260212_210305_314849.jpg,assets/03_original.jpg,assets/03_edited.jpg
4,more boring,bus,"Repaint the bus body to a plain matte light gray, removing the bright orange color.",True,True,"The bus body color appears changed from bright orange to a plain light gray/white with plausible shading and reflections. Surrounding scene, camera viewpoint, and overall lighting/style remain consistent with the original. No obvious unintended edits outside the bus; the change is localized and matches the edit plan.",/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/01_raw/place_pulse_bottom5_5each/more_boring/04_more_boring_51414c6efdc9f04926007327.jpg,/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/02_counterfactual/image_edit_baseline_20260212_210339_668052.jpg,assets/04_original.jpg,assets/04_edited.jpg
5,more boring,crosswalk marking,Repaint the crosswalk marking to a faded light-gray so it blends more with the asphalt.,False,False,"The edit does not match the plan: instead of fading the existing white crosswalk stripes to light-gray, the stripes were replaced/covered by a large solid rectangular patch across the road. This looks like an added painted slab and is not physically plausible for a faded crosswalk. Repair: keep the original stripe geometry and edges, reduce contrast/saturation to a light-gray with slight uneven wear/texture so asphalt shows through; avoid adding new filled shapes beyond the stripe areas.",/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/01_raw/place_pulse_bottom5_5each/more_boring/05_more_boring_513d6924fdc9f03587004616.jpg,/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/02_counterfactual/image_edit_baseline_20260212_210416_771687.jpg,assets/05_original.jpg,assets/05_edited.jpg
