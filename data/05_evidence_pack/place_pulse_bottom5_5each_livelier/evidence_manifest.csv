1,livelier,tunnel wall panels,"Repaint the tunnel wall panels with a brighter, more saturated color.",True,True,"The tunnel wall panels have been repainted to a brighter, more saturated yellow while preserving panel seams and perspective, and the change looks physically plausible under tunnel lighting. The edit appears localized to the wall panels with no noticeable viewpoint, global color/lighting, or surrounding context drift.",/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/01_raw/place_pulse_bottom5_5each/livelier/01_livelier_513e6501fdc9f0358700b8ed.jpg,/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/02_counterfactual/image_edit_baseline_20260212_210007_703290.jpg,assets/01_original.jpg,assets/01_edited.jpg
2,livelier,car,"Repaint the small car in a brighter, more saturated color (e.g., vivid red) to make it stand out.",True,True,"The small car appears repainted to a brighter, more saturated red while the rest of the scene (road, buildings, sky, debris pile, lighting) remains unchanged. The color change looks plausible with consistent shading and no noticeable spillover or artifacts. Edit is localized to the car with no camera/viewpoint or global color drift detected.",/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/01_raw/place_pulse_bottom5_5each/livelier/02_livelier_5140b993fdc9f04926001e97.jpg,/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/02_counterfactual/image_edit_baseline_20260212_210030_176686.jpg,assets/02_original.jpg,assets/02_edited.jpg
3,livelier,building facade,"Repaint the building facade with a bright, saturated color to add visual energy.",True,True,"The edit repaints the intended building facade (left-side building) to a bright saturated pink/red, which looks plausible as exterior paint and stays consistent with the scene lighting. The change is localized to the facade with no noticeable camera, lighting, or surrounding-object drift.",/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/01_raw/place_pulse_bottom5_5each/livelier/03_livelier_513d2cdcfdc9f0358700246e.jpg,/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/02_counterfactual/image_edit_baseline_20260212_210059_804419.jpg,assets/03_original.jpg,assets/03_edited.jpg
4,livelier,concrete wall,"Repaint the concrete wall a bright, saturated color to make it stand out.",False,False,"The edit did not repaint the concrete wall; instead, large areas of the surrounding hillside/vegetation were globally recolored to an orange tone, indicating a broad color shift. This violates minimality and causes drift in scene appearance. Repair: apply a localized mask only to the concrete wall surfaces and change their paint color to a bright saturated hue while keeping all other areas (vegetation, road, sky) unchanged in color and lighting.",/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/01_raw/place_pulse_bottom5_5each/livelier/04_livelier_514091a5fdc9f04926000554.jpg,/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/02_counterfactual/image_edit_baseline_20260212_210121_849558.jpg,assets/04_original.jpg,assets/04_edited.jpg
5,livelier,parked van,"Repaint the parked van in a brighter, more saturated color (e.g., red) while keeping its shape and lighting consistent.",True,True,"The parked van was repainted to a brighter saturated red while preserving its shape, position, and scene lighting/shadows. No noticeable changes to camera viewpoint, global color/contrast, or surrounding objects/background.",/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/01_raw/place_pulse_bottom5_5each/livelier/05_livelier_50f5ec9cfdc9f065f0008a7c.jpg,/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/02_counterfactual/image_edit_baseline_20260212_210148_266535.jpg,assets/05_original.jpg,assets/05_edited.jpg
