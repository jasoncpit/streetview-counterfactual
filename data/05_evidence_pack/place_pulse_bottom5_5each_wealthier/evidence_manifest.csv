1,wealthier,utility pole,"Repaint the utility pole with a clean, uniform neutral color to cover the peeling paint and stains.",True,False,"The utility pole repaint looks plausible (uniform neutral color and consistent lighting), but the edit is not minimal: the pole appears enlarged/thicker and simplified, and nearby attachments/texture details (stickers/markings) are removed beyond just covering peeling paint. To improve, keep the pole’s original diameter/geometry and retain attached hardware while only changing the surface finish to a clean coat.",/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/01_raw/place_pulse_bottom5_5each/wealthier/01_wealthier_50f44567fdc9f065f00034df.jpg,/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/02_counterfactual/image_edit_baseline_20260212_210804_365805.jpg,assets/01_original.jpg,assets/01_edited.jpg
2,wealthier,wall,"Repaint the wall to fully cover the graffiti with a clean, uniform light neutral color.",True,True,"The wall on the right has been repainted to a uniform light neutral tone and the graffiti is fully covered. The change is localized to the wall surface, with consistent perspective and lighting; surrounding objects and overall scene appearance remain unchanged.",/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/01_raw/place_pulse_bottom5_5each/wealthier/02_wealthier_51414ec4fdc9f04926007916.jpg,/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/02_counterfactual/image_edit_baseline_20260212_210822_077313.jpg,assets/02_original.jpg,assets/02_edited.jpg
3,wealthier,van,Repaint the van into a clean glossy black finish with no visible rust or dirt.,True,True,"The van has been repainted to a glossy black and appears clean, matching the requested edit. The change is localized to the van with no noticeable alterations to the rest of the scene (camera/viewpoint, lighting, or surrounding objects) beyond the repaint.",/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/01_raw/place_pulse_bottom5_5each/wealthier/03_wealthier_5140b9e0fdc9f04926001f2e.jpg,/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/02_counterfactual/image_edit_baseline_20260212_210838_157651.jpg,assets/03_original.jpg,assets/03_edited.jpg
4,wealthier,road surface,"Resurface the cracked asphalt so it appears smooth, dark, and newly paved.",False,False,"The road surface was changed, but it looks like a uniform, overly dark matte overlay with a hard edge/shape that doesn’t blend into the scene’s perspective, texture, or lighting (missing aggregate texture, subtle tonal variation, and realistic shoulder transitions). The edit also appears to spill slightly beyond natural road boundaries in places, making it look cut-out rather than newly paved. To fix: add fine asphalt texture/noise and subtle shading consistent with sun direction, feather edges into existing shoulders, preserve road crown/perspective cues, and avoid a single flat black fill.",/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/01_raw/place_pulse_bottom5_5each/wealthier/04_wealthier_5185d1a8fdc9f03fd500111e.jpg,/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/02_counterfactual/image_edit_baseline_20260212_210903_646612.jpg,assets/04_original.jpg,assets/04_edited.jpg
5,wealthier,window,Replace the small window with a modern glass window featuring a clean aluminum frame.,True,True,"The small window on the right wall was replaced with a larger modern-looking glass window with a clean frame, and it appears plausibly integrated with the building surface and lighting. The edit is localized to the window area with no noticeable changes to viewpoint, global color/lighting, or surrounding objects. If stricter minimality is desired, keep the replacement closer to the original window’s size/position while updating only the frame/material.",/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/01_raw/place_pulse_bottom5_5each/wealthier/05_wealthier_5140d86bfdc9f049260039ea.jpg,/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/02_counterfactual/image_edit_baseline_20260212_210923_464117.jpg,assets/05_original.jpg,assets/05_edited.jpg
