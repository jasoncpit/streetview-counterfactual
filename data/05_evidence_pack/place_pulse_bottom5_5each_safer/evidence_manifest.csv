1,safer,porch light,"Brighten and replace the dim porch light fixture with a visibly lit, modern LED-style wall lamp.",True,True,"The porch light on the left brick wall was changed to a brighter, visibly lit fixture and the added glow looks plausible for the scene. The edit appears localized to the porch light area with no noticeable changes to camera/viewpoint, global color/lighting, or surrounding objects. If a more 'modern LED-style wall lamp' is required, the fixture shape could be made more contemporary (clean rectangular/sconce design) while keeping the same placement and localized illumination.",/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/01_raw/place_pulse_bottom5_5each/safer/01_safer_513d5e7dfdc9f03587003a89.jpg,/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/02_counterfactual/image_edit_baseline_20260212_205802_582154.jpg,assets/01_original.jpg,assets/01_edited.jpg
2,safer,corrugated roof,"Repair the damaged corrugated metal roof by replacing the broken, bent sheets with intact matching panels.",True,True,"The corrugated roof appears repaired: the previously bent/broken sheets are replaced with intact, uniformly aligned corrugated panels consistent with the scene’s perspective and lighting. No obvious changes to surrounding buildings, wires, walls, or camera viewpoint/color balance. If anything, ensure the new panels retain some weathering/age to better match the rest of the structure, but the edit is plausible and localized.",/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/01_raw/place_pulse_bottom5_5each/safer/02_safer_50f5e5e0fdc9f065f0006b2e.jpg,/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/02_counterfactual/image_edit_baseline_20260212_205820_132232.jpg,assets/02_original.jpg,assets/02_edited.jpg
3,safer,barbed wire,Remove the barbed wire coils from the top of the wall.,True,False,"The barbed wire was not removed; it remains visible along the top of the wall. The scene otherwise appears consistent with no major viewpoint or lighting drift. To satisfy the edit plan, cleanly inpaint/erase the wire coils across the entire wall top (including distant sections) while preserving the wall edge, sky, and background details.",/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/01_raw/place_pulse_bottom5_5each/safer/03_safer_513e1b20fdc9f035870093af.jpg,/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/02_counterfactual/image_edit_baseline_20260212_205838_996526.jpg,assets/03_original.jpg,assets/03_edited.jpg
4,safer,crosswalk marking,"Repaint the faded white crosswalk stripes to be bright, solid, and clearly visible.",False,False,"The edit does not match the plan: instead of repainting existing faded crosswalk stripes near the intersection, it adds multiple long, perfectly straight, high-contrast white bands extending far down the road (more like lane markings). The markings ignore road wear/perspective blending and look composited. To fix: locate the actual crosswalk area and repaint only those stripes, keeping correct crosswalk geometry (short transverse bars), consistent perspective, slight texture/edge wear, and matching scene lighting.",/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/01_raw/place_pulse_bottom5_5each/safer/04_safer_513d9e4dfdc9f0358700837a.jpg,/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/02_counterfactual/image_edit_baseline_20260212_205905_366554.jpg,assets/04_original.jpg,assets/04_edited.jpg
5,safer,trash pile,Remove the piled trash so the ground area is clean.,True,True,"The trash pile at the bottom-left/center has been removed and replaced with plausible ground texture. Surrounding wall, barbed wire, sky, and car remain consistent with no noticeable viewpoint or global color/lighting drift. Only minor smoothing/blur in the cleaned area; if desired, add a bit more pavement texture/noise to better match the original ground detail.",/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/01_raw/place_pulse_bottom5_5each/safer/05_safer_50f5eaadfdc9f065f0007c10.jpg,/Users/admin/streetview-counterfactual/data/02_counterfactual/image_edit_baseline_20260212_205947_792161.jpg,assets/05_original.jpg,assets/05_edited.jpg
