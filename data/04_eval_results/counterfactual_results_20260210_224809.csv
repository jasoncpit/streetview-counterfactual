The lamp head glow looks overpowered and the surrounding sky gradient/contrast has changed, violating the plan’s “no change to overall exposure/color” constraint. Repair: re-edit using a tight mask on only the lamp head, add a small local halo (low radius, low opacity) and a very faint highlight on the adjacent pole surface only; avoid any broad sky/scene brightening or lens flare."

Several stripes look extended/shifted relative to their original footprint and perspective, and some edges appear more re-rendered than subtly thickened, implying gaps/positions may have drifted. To match the plan, uniformly thicken each stripe only inward from both long edges (preserving outer boundaries), keeping stripe endpoints, count, spacing, and overall crosswalk footprint identical to the original."
