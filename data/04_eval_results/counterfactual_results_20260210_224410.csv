The glow is too large and reads like an added light source rather than a subtle lamp-head-only glow, and it appears to introduce a global exposure/contrast shift (scene looks slightly darker/greener) beyond the target pixels. To fix: keep the original scene identical, redraw only the lamp head geometry (small fixture shape) and confine a warm glow + tiny halo strictly within/just around the lamp head pixels with no spill or overall relighting."
